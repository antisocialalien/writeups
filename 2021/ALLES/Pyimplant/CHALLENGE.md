Our company just developed an awesome python TicTacToe game. Before shipping, it was compiled to bytecode to minimize size and enable a faster download all over the world. However, in the recent days we found a version of our bytecode online, which produces another sha256sum as our original one, but it still works properly and has all our fancy features!? What did they manipulate? Can you find any implants?

You'll find the source code and the manipulated version attached in the ZIP file.
