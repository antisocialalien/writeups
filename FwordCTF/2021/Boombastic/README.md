## Intro
**Boombastic** was a crypto challenge at FwordCTF 2021.  

Following Kerkhoff's principle you were given the [source](boombastic.py) of a program mimicing some kind of cinema
where you could either draw some ordinary tickets at random or actually enter the cinema if you provide a special VIP ticket.  

## Investigation
The ticket generation function in use derives a ticket `T = {r,s,p}` from a message `M` by calculating  
```
r = (y^2-1) (x^2 )^(-1)     (mod p)
s = (y+1) x^(-1)            (mod p)
```
where  
- `p` is a random prime
- `x âˆˆ Z_p` is a random secret 
- `y` is the numerical representation of `M` obtained by its sha256 hash valueo

We are also given an encryption oracle from which we can obtain random tickets generated by the program.  

## Solution
The problem here is that the random secret `x` is being re-used in all the ticket generations for the whole lifespan of the program. Thus, given the encryption
oracle we can obtain a random ticket `T = {r,s,p}` and calculate `x` as follows:  
```
s = (y+1) x^(-1)                (mod p)

=> x^(-1) = s/(y+1)             (mod p) // (1)

r = (y^2-1) (x^2 )^(-1)         (mod p)
  = (y^2-1) x^(-1) x^(-1)       (mod p) // substitute with (1)
  = (y^2-1) (s/(y+1))^2         (mod p)

=> y = (-s^2-r) (r-s^2)^(-1)    (mod p) // (2)

substitute (1) with (2)

=> x = (s/(y+1)^(-1)            (mod p)
```

Another quick look into the [source](boombastic.py) tells us the message `M` to be used for the VIP ticket is the string *Boombastic*.  
Now we have all we need to craft us some VIP ticket by ourselves and enter the cinema!
